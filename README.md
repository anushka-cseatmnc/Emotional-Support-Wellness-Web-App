## 🌱 Emotional Support & Wellness Web App

*"Everyone deserves emotional support and understanding - accessible anytime, anywhere."*


## 🔍 Overview
The **Emotional Support and Wellness Web App** is a RAG-based emotional support assistant that provides empathetic responses and emotional health guidance using a curated set of wellness and emotional support documents. It uses **local embeddings and local LLMs (fully offline)**, making it cost-effective and private.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Most people struggle with emotional wellness due to:
- **Complex emotional situations** without guidance
- **Costly emotional support services**
- **Low awareness of emotional health resources**
- **Lack of immediate empathetic responses**

## 💡 Solution
Our app solves this with:
- **Local RAG Pipeline** using LangChain + FAISS + Mistral 7B
- **Curated Emotional Support Knowledge Base** with wellness documents
- **Streamlit Chat UI** with FastAPI backend
- **Offline, privacy-respecting architecture** (no API keys!)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
| Layer | Tools Used |
|-------|------------|
| **Embedding** | HuggingFaceEmbeddings (MiniLM) |
| **Vector DB** | Chroma (FAISS backend) |
| **Document** | LangChain PyPDFLoader, TextSplitter |
| **LLM** | Mistral-7B-Instruct (GGUF) via ctransformers |
| **Backend** | FastAPI |
| **Frontend** | Streamlit |
| **Prompting** | LangChain PromptTemplate |

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Document Retrieval → LLM Processing → Empathetic Response
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c426b1-6524-4b8f-8d9c-91c9d1cef618)


### Core Components

1. **ingest.py** – Document Preprocessing & Vector Storage
   - Loads emotional support documents
   - Splits into 1000-character chunks with 200 overlap
   - Embeds using MiniLM → stores in persistent FAISS (Chroma)

2. **rag_pipeline.py** – RAG Chain Construction
   - Loads FAISS vector DB
   - Loads quantized Mistral-7B using CTransformers
   - Custom Prompt ensures:
     - Only relevant emotional support info
     - Empathetic and supportive responses
     - Fallback if answer not found

3. **main.py** – FastAPI Backend
   - POST /chat → gets emotional support response
   - POST /query → gets answer + cited sources
   - GET /health → for uptime check

Of course! Here’s a simplified and cleaner version of your deployment and model selection explanation. It keeps things clear and professional without sounding overly technical:

### Why This App Can’t Be Deployed on Free Cloud Tiers

Although this project runs completely offline and doesn’t depend on external APIs, it requires a GPU, enough memory, and persistent storage to work properly. Free cloud platforms like Render, Hugging Face Spaces, Heroku, or AWS Free Tier don’t provide enough resources to host this app. Here's why:

- **GPU is Required**: Even with compression, the Mistral 7B model still needs a GPU for fast, stable responses. Free services don’t offer this.
- **Not Enough RAM**: Running the model and ChromaDB together needs –16 GB RAM, far more than the ~1 GB free tiers allow.
- **Storage Limitations**: The model weights (~4GB) and vector database (~5–10 GB) won’t fit within the tiny storage limits of free hosting plans.
- **Slow and Unreliable**: Free tiers often pause idle apps or limit connections, causing delays and breaking the experience for users needing emotional support.

### 💡 Why I Didn’t Use a Smaller Language Model
- Smaller models (like 1B–3B) were tested but didn’t perform well.
- They couldn’t handle emotional context accurately or give empathetic responses.
- They also struggled in combining retrieved information from documents, which is key in a RAG setup.

> That’s why I chose the 7B model—it gives better, safer, and more human-like support without relying on cloud APIs.

### Live Demo & System Walkthrough

To demonstrate the app’s capabilities without requiring live hosting, a recorded demo video is provided. It includes:
